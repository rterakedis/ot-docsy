{{% blocks/cover title="About OneTrust Tech Docs" image_anchor="bottom" height="auto" %}}

Tech Docs is where we bring together years of Privacy and Product knowledge to help you understand how to use OneTrust 
  products and services.  While [My OneTrust](https://my.onetrust.com) remains *the* place to understand the basics of our Trust Intelligence
  platform, Tech Docs is where we aim to help you expand and combine those building blocks into your complete Trust and Privacy program.

[Goldydocs](https://test.com) is a sample site using the <a href="https://github.com/google/docsy">Docsy</a> Hugo theme that shows what it can do and provides you with a template site structure. Itâ€™s designed for you to clone and edit as much as you like. See the different sections of the documentation and site for more ideas.
